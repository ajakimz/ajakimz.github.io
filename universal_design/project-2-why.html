            <h2>The Purpose Behind Universal Design</h2>
            <p>Universal Design matters because the internet is meant to be a shared space. When even one group of users is excluded due to inaccessible design, we fail the core purpose of the web. Designing inclusively ensures that every person (regardless of device, disability, or environment) can interact with information without extra barriers or frustration.</p>

            <h2>Why Accessibility Benefits Everyone</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Better usability:</strong> Clean layouts, clear structure, and readable content improve the experience for all users.</li>
                <li><strong>Mobile environments:</strong> Accessibility features like high contrast and flexible text help outdoors, on small screens, or in motion.</li>
                <li><strong>Temporary limitations:</strong> A broken arm, noisy environment, bad WiFi — accessibility supports users in everyday limitations.</li>
                <li><strong>SEO and performance:</strong> Semantic HTML and clean code improve search performance and speed.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Social and Ethical Case</h2>
            <p>The digital world is a central part of modern life — education, employment, healthcare, government, and social connection all rely on it. When the web is not accessible, people are excluded from essential resources. Universal Design aligns with ethical responsibility, digital equity, and the belief that technology should empower, not limit.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Legal Responsibility</h2>
            <p>Many countries require accessible digital content, including the U.S. (ADA, Section 508) and global WCAG standards. Businesses and institutions risk legal consequences when they ignore accessibility, making Universal Design not only the right choice but a necessary one.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Why Standards Matter</h2>
            <p>Web standards like semantic HTML, ARIA, and responsive design ensure that content works consistently across devices and assistive technologies. Standards reduce confusion, improve compatibility, and set a foundation for meaningful, accessible experiences.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Importance of Accessibility Testing</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Testing uncovers barriers early, reducing redesign work later.</li>
                <li>Evaluation tools give real insight into how different people experience the site.</li>
                <li>Mobile accessibility testing ensures the design is flexible and resilient.</li>
                <li>Continuous testing creates an iterative cycle of improvement.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Advocacy for Universal Design</h2>
            <p>Universal Design isn’t just a technique — it’s a movement. Advocating for accessibility in your team, workplace, or community changes the culture of design. Grassroots movements like CSS Zen Garden and Web Standards transformed the web; Universal Design is the next transformation.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Universal Design matters because it creates a web that is fair, functional, ethical, and usable. When we treat accessibility as a core design requirement, we build a better internet — one that reflects the diversity of real people and supports their ability to learn, work, create, and connect.</p>
