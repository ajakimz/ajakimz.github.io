                I am currently a 3rd year student at the University of Colorado Boulder getting a Bachelor of Science in Creative Technology and Design with a minor in Business. My focus is in UI/UX and I will also be getting a certificate in UX Design from CU Boulder.

                I am originally from Spokane, WA and before coming to Boulder, CO I completed my studies at Spokane Falls Community College to receive my Associate of Arts.
