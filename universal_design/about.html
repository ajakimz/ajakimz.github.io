    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am currently a 3rd year student at the University of Colorado Boulder getting a Bachelor of Science in Creative Technology and Design with a minor in 
        Business. My focus is in UI/UX and I will also be getting a certificate in UX Design from CU Boulder.

        I am originally from Spokane, WA and before coming to Boulder, CO I completed my studies at Spokane Falls Community College to receive my Associate of 
        Arts.
