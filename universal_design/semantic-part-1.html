            <p>Launched on April 18, 1983, under the name <b>The Disney Channel</b> as a <a href="#">premium channel</a> on top of <a href="#">basic cable</a> <a href="#">television systems</a>, it originally showcased programming towards families due to availability of home television sets locally at the time. It dropped "The" from its name in 1997, thus getting rebranded as <b>Disney Channel</b>, with its programming shifting focus to target mainly children and <a href="#">adolescents</a> ages 6–14.<a href="#">[2]</a> The channel showcases original first-run <a href="#">children's television series</a>, <a href="#">theatrically released</a> and original <a href="#">television films</a> and other selected third-party programming.</p>

The channel – which initially maintained a 16-hour-per-day programming schedule from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. Eastern and <a href="#">Pacific Time</a> – would become available on cable providers in all 50 U.S. states by September 1983, and accrue a base of more than 611,000 subscribers by December of that year.<a href="#">[5]</a><a href="#">[7]</a><a href="#">[8]</a> In October 1983, the channel debuted its first made-for-cable movie, <em><a href="#">Tiger Town</a></em>, which earned the channel a <a href="#">CableACE Award</a>.<a href="#">[8]</a> The channel had reached profitability by January 1985, with its programming reaching 1.75 million subscribers by that point.</p>

            <p><a href="#">Television films</a> have also been produced for broadcast on Disney Channel since its launch under the banner of <em>Disney Channel Premiere Films</em>, with the first film released being <em><a href="#">Tiger Town</a></em> in 1983, until October 1997, which is when they stopped using the "Premiere Films" label and renamed it the "<a href="#">Disney Channel Original Movies</a>" (DCOM) thereafter. The first movie to be released under the Disney Channel Original Movie category was <em><a href="#">Under Wraps</a></em>, a Halloween themed movie that aired for the first time on Disney Channel on October 25, 1997.<a href="#">[12]</a><a href="#">[13]</a><a href="#">[14]</a><a href="#">[15]</a></p>
            <p>The most successful original film under the banner in terms of popularity and accolades is <em><a href="#">High School Musical 2</a></em>, which debuted on August 17, 2007, to 17.2 million viewers and set a current longstanding record for the highest-rated television premiere in the history of the channel.<a href="#">[16]</a> Following <em>High School Musical 2</em>, the movie that had the second highest-rated Disney Channel Original Movie (DCOM) premiere was <em><a href="#">Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie</a></em>, followed by <em><a href="#">Camp Rock</a></em>, <em><a href="#">Descendants 2</a></em>, <em><a href="#">Princess Protection Program</a></em>, <em><a href="#">Teen Beach Movie</a></em>, and <em><a href="#">Jump In!</a></em>.<a href="#">[17]</a><a href="#">[18]</a> It also set a basic cable record for the single most-watched television program until December 3, 2007, when corporate sister channel, <a href="#">ESPN</a>, surpassed it with the telecast of an <a href="#">NFL</a> <a href="#">game</a> between the <a href="#">New England Patriots</a> and <a href="#">Baltimore Ravens</a> on its <em><a href="#">Monday Night Football</a></em> programme by 0.3 million viewers more (17.5 million viewers). <em><a href="#">The Cheetah Girls</a></em> media franchise was also notably successful in terms of merchandise and sales for its concert tours and soundtrack albums. Its debut film from 2003, being the first Disney Channel original musical television film, premiered to over 84 million global viewers and <a href="#">its sequel</a> premiered to 8.1 million American viewers and in the process became the most successful of the film series. An 86-date concert tour featuring <a href="#">the eponymous girl group</a> was ranked as one of the top 10 concert tours of 2006, smashing the record at the <a href="#">Houston Rodeo</a> previously set by <a href="#">Elvis Presley</a> in 1973, selling out with 73,500 tickets in three minutes at one point.</p>
            <p>In addition to its original television films, Disney Channel has rights to theatrically released feature films, with some film rights shared with sister network, <a href="#">Freeform</a>. Alongside films released by <a href="#">Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures</a> (mainly consisting of releases from <a href="#">Walt Disney Pictures</a>, <a href="#">Walt Disney Animation Studios</a> and <a href="#">Pixar</a>), the channel also maintains rights to films from other studios. Some films released by <a href="#">Bagdasarian Productions</a> (such as <em><a href="#">The Chipmunk Adventure</a></em> and <em><a href="#">Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet Frankenstein</a></em>) have also aired on Disney Channel, although most of them are not currently owned by any of the Walt Disney Company's divisions.</p>

            <h4>Former</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Disney Night Time</b> – As The Disney Channel as a premium channel from its launch until April 6, 1997, this block featured programming aimed at older parental audiences during the evening and overnight hours under the banner title "Disney Nighttime". The content seen in these blocks was devoid of sexual and violent content. Programming seen during Disney Nighttime included older feature films (similar to those seen at the time on <a href="#">American Movie Classics</a>, and eventually <a href="#">Turner Classic Movies</a>, with both Disney film titles and movies from other <a href="#">film studios</a> mixed in), alongside original concert specials (featuring artists ranging from <a href="#">Rick Springfield</a> to <a href="#">Jon Secada</a> to <a href="#">Elton John</a>), variety specials and <a href="#">documentaries</a>.[<a href="#">citation needed</a>]</li>

                <li><b>Totally Kids Only ("TKO")</b> – an afternoon lineup of live-action and animated series introduced in 1992,<a href="#">[27]</a> which became the overall branding for the channel's daytime children's programs from 1995 to 1996.</li>

                <li><b>Magical World of Animals</b>[<a href="#">citation needed</a>] – an hour-long block of wildlife series aimed at children that ran from August 1997 to 1999.

                <li><b>Vault Disney</b> – premiered in September 1997,<a href="#">[8]</a><a href="#">[35]</a> five months after Disney Channel's first major rebrand, replacing the Disney Nighttime lineup.

Older Disney feature films also were part of the lineup from 1997 to 2000 but aired in a reduced capacity. The block also featured <em><a href="#">The Ink and Paint Club</a></em>, an <a href="#">anthology series</a> featuring Disney animated shorts, which became the only remaining program on the channel to feature these shorts by 1999, upon the removal of <em><a href="#">Quack Pack</a></em> from the schedule. The channel discontinued the block in September 2002, in favor of running reruns of its original and acquired series during the late evening and overnight hours (which comparative to the adult-focused Vault Disney, are aimed at children and teenagers, an audience that is typically asleep during that time period).</li>
                <li><b>Zoog Disney</b> – launched in August 1998, a program block that originally aired only on weekend afternoons from 4:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. Eastern/Pacific. The hosts for the block were "Zoogs", animated anthropomorphic robot/alien creature-hybrid characters with human voices (some of whom acted like teenagers). The block unified television and the Internet, allowing viewer comments and scores from players of ZoogDisney.com's online games to be aired on the channel during regular programming in a ticker format (which the channel continued to use after the block was discontinued, however, the ticker has been all but completely dropped from on-air usage as of May 2010).<a href="#">[36]</a> From June 2000 to August 2002, the afternoon and primetime lineups on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays were branded under the umbrella title "Zoog Weekendz". The Zoogs were redesigned with <a href="#">cel shading</a> and given mature voices in 2000, though the remade Zoog characters were discontinued after less than a year; the entire Zoog Disney block was phased out by September 2002.<a href="#">[37]</a></li>
                <li><b>Disney Replay</b> – "Disney Replay" was a block that premiered on April 17, 2013, featuring episodes of defunct Disney Channel Original Series that premiered between 2000 and 2007 (such as <em><a href="#">Lizzie McGuire</a></em>, <em><a href="#">That's So Raven</a></em>, <em><a href="#">The Suite Life of Zack & Cody</a></em> and <em><a href="#">Hannah Montana</a></em>).<a href="#">[38]</a> Airing Wednesday nights/early Thursday mornings (as a nod to the popular <a href="#">social media</a> trend "Throwback Thursday"), originally from 12:00 to 1:00 a.m. Eastern and Pacific Time, the block expanded to six hours (running until 6:00 a.m. Eastern/Pacific) on August 14, 2014.<a href="#">[39]</a> Programs featured on Disney Replay were added to the WATCH Disney Channel service on August 16, 2014. The block was discontinued on April 28, 2016, and moved to <a href="#">Freeform</a> with a new name: That's So Throwback.</li>
                <li><b><a href="#">Disney XD</a> on Disney Channel</b> – "Disney XD on Disney Channel" is the former branding of two blocks airing on Friday and Saturday nights; an animated block airing Fridays from 9:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., showing series mainly exclusive to Disney XD such as <em><a href="#">Phineas and Ferb</a></em>, <em><a href="#">Star vs. the Forces of Evil</a></em>, <em><a href="#">Milo Murphy's Law</a></em>, and <em><a href="#">DuckTales</a></em>, and a live-action block airing Saturdays from 10:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m., airing series such as <em><a href="#">MECH-X4</a></em> and <em><a href="#">Walk the Prank</a></em>. It was discontinued as Disney XD's carriage became equivalent to that of Disney Channel.</li>

            <h3>Bumpers</h3>
            <p>In between regularly scheduled programming and advertisement breaks, Disney Channel features <a href="#">bumpers</a>. These bumpers have varied in content substantially throughout the history of the channel, created using a broad array of artistic methods such as <a href="#">traditional animation</a>, <a href="#">digital animation</a>, <a href="#">claymation</a>, <a href="#">live action</a>, and <a href="#">puppeteering</a>. They have been praised for their high quality composition and ingenuity.<a href="#">[40]</a></p>
            <p>However, they became especially iconic in September 2002, when Disney Channel underwent a major rebranding, including in its bumpers and logo. These bumpers highlighted the iconic 'mouse ears' logo throughout them, featuring various videos that culminated in both the appearance of the logo, alongside a newly introduced theme song, which is regarded as its most recognizable and is still used to this day. This theme song consists of a four-note mnemonic jingle composed by <a href="#">Alex Lasarenko</a>, former executive of Tonal Sounds and creative director at <a href="#">Elias Arts</a>.<a href="#">[40]</a><a href="#">[41]</a></p>
            <p>In addition to its logo and jingle, Disney Channel's most recognizable bumper format consists of a celebrity or figure from one of its programs holding a wand and drawing the then-current form of the Disney Channel logo on the screen. This celebrity will introduce their name, the program they are featured on, and finish with the line "And you're watching Disney Channel." Dubbed a 'Wand ID' by fans, this format typically ends in a variation of the mnemonic.<a href="#">[40]</a></p>

            <h3>Sports</h3>
            <p>For a period, <a href="#">ESPN</a>'s broadcasts of the <a href="#">Little League World Series</a> baseball tournament frequently featured <a href="#">cross-promotion</a> with music-related Disney Channel properties, with past editions having featured collaborations with <em><a href="#">High School Musical</a></em>, the <em><a href="#">Jonas Brothers</a></em>, <em><a href="#">Camp Rock</a></em>, and <em><a href="#">Phineas and Ferb</a></em>.<a href="#">[42]</a></p>
            <p>In March 2023, Disney Channel broadcast a live professional sporting event for the first time, carrying a youth-oriented alternate broadcast of a <a href="#">National Hockey League</a> (NHL) game—known as the <em>Big City Greens Classic</em>—as part of <a href="#">ESPN's coverage of the league</a>. The broadcast was themed around the Disney Channel animated series <em><a href="#">Big City Greens</a></em>, visualizing data from the league's player and <a href="#">puck</a> tracking system with 3D animated players.<a href="#">[43]</a><a href="#">[44]</a><a href="#">[45]</a></p>

            <h4>Disney Jr.</h4>
            <p class="indent"><em>Main articles: Disney Jr. and Playhouse Disney</em></p>
            <p>Disney Jr. is a daily morning program block aimed at preschoolers, spiritually succeeding <em>Playhouse Disney</em> which launched on April 6, 1997, as part of Disney Channel's morning lineup. On May 26, 2010, Disney General Entertainment Content (at the time known as <em>Disney-ABC Television</em> Group) announced the expansion of the block in to a 24/7 cable and satellite channel which debuted on March 23, 2012[4] The channel would be commercial-free channel and compete with other preschooler-skewing cable channels such as the Nick Jr. Channel and Universal Kids (previously known as <em>PBS Kids Sprout</em> and then <em>Sprout</em>).[46] The channel features programs from Disney Channel's existing preschool programming library and films/movies from the Walt Disney Pictures film library. On its launch, Disney Junior took over the channel space held by Soapnet – a Disney-owned cable channel featuring soap operas – due to that genre's decline in popularity on broadcast television and the growth of video on demand, online streaming, and digital video recorders negating the need for a linear channel devoted to the soap opera genre. After a period during which cable providers unwilling to drop the network immediately retained it to prevent subscriber cancellations, Soapnet ceased all operations on December 31, 2013.[47] The former Playhouse Disney block on Disney Channel rebranded as Disney Junior on February 14, 2011, along with the existing international channels; they had their names shortened to "Disney Jr." since June 1, 2024, although spelt/pronounced the same as before. Disney-ABC Television Group once planned to launch a <em>Playhouse Disney</em>-branded channel in the United States in 2001, however it never happened despite launching internationally.[48]</p>

            <h4>Disney XD</h4>
            <p class="indent"><em>Main article: Disney XD</em></p>
            <p>Launched on February 13, 2009,[49] as the successor to Toon Disney, Disney XD is a cable and satellite television channel which was originally aimed at young male audiences aged 6 to 14, but has since included girls in its programming.[50] The channel showcases action and comedy programming from Disney Channel and the former Jetix block from Toon Disney, alongside some first-run original programming and off-network syndicated shows. Disney XD, unlike its sister channels Disney Channel and Disney Junior, operates as an ad-supported service, similar to its predecessor Toon Disney. The channel carries the same name as an unrelated mini-site and media player on Disney.com, which stood for Disney Xtreme Digital, though it is said that the "XD" in the channel's name does not have an actual meaning.[51]</p>

            <h3>Former sister channels</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Toon Disney</b> – Launched on April 18, 1998, during the 15th anniversary celebration of the launch of sister network, Disney Channel,[52] this channel was aimed at children and teenagers between the ages of 6 and 18. The network's main competitors at launch were Cartoon Network from <em>Warner Bros. Discovery</em> (a merged company of previous owner Time Warner/WarnerMedia (who absorbed Turner Broadcasting System, the company that launched the channel) and Discovery, Inc.) and Nickelodeon from Paramount Global (formerly the first and the second incarnations of <em>Viacom</em> and <em>ViacomCBS</em>). Toon Disney initially operated as a commercial-free service from its launch until September 1999 when, unlike Disney Channel, it became ad-supported. The channel carried a mix of reruns of animated productions from Disney Television Animation (formerly <em>Walt Disney Television Animation</em>) and Disney Channel, alongside some third-party programs from other distributors, animated films and original programming. In 2004, the channel introduced a nighttime program block aimed at children ages 7 to 14 called Jetix, which featured action-oriented animated and live-action series.

            <h2>Marketing programs</h2>
            <p>In June 2012, the Walt Disney Company announced that it would stop advertising or promoting food or beverage products that do not meet strict nutritional guidelines. Disney Channel purportedly became the first media company to take such a stance on stopping the marketing of junk food products to kids. Due to its commercial-free format, such advertising appears only in the form of underwriter sponsorships during promotional breaks.[72]</p>
            <p>On July 1, 2012, Disney Channel began providing Descriptive Video Service audio in compliance with the 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010, which required network owned-and-operated stations and affiliates in the 25 largest television markets as well as the five highest-rated cable and satellite channels (including Disney Channel) to offer audio descriptions for the blind. This is accompanied by an on-screen mark at the beginning of certain scheduled programming indicating to viewers that the service is available. Some episodes of <em>Gravity Falls</em>, <em>Austin and Ally</em>, <em>Good Luck Charlie</em>, and <em>Phineas and Ferb</em> show the AD))) mark and a 2-tone sound repeated 3 times at the beginning of the episode to give notice of the audio description track available through the SAP feed.

        <section id="criticism">
            <h2>Criticism</h2>
            <p>Some critics disapprove of the Disney Channel marketing strategy led by Anne Sweeney,[80] president of the Disney Channel from 1996 to 2014.[81] Under Sweeney, the Disney Channel's programming was geared mainly towards preteen and teenage girls, with a decrease in animated programming.[82] Criticism was also aimed at removing almost all Walt-era and pre-1990s material from the channel in 2002 with the removal of the late-night "Vault Disney" block devoted to this material, which used to make up the majority of the channel's programming since its inception in 1983.[83][84] In 2008, Sweeney explained that Disney Channel, resulting from its multi-platform marketing strategy using television and music, would become "the major profit driver for the [Walt Disney] Company."[84]</p>
            <p>The channel has also pulled (and sometimes re-shot) episodes that have featured subject matter deemed inappropriate for its target audience, due either to humor or to timing of real-life events.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In November 2008, the episode "No Sugar, Sugar" (<em>Hannah Montana</em>), in which Mitchel Musso's character, Oliver Oken, is revealed to have Type 1 diabetes, was pulled before its broadcast, due to parent complaints about its portrayal of diabetics and sugar intake.[85]</li>
                <li>In December 2011, Disney Channel pulled episodes of two of its original series, due to complaints on Twitter from Demi Lovato about their portrayal of eating disorders. Pulled episodes included "Party It Up" (<em>Shake It Up</em>) and "Colbie Caillat" (<em>So Random!</em>).[86][87][88][89]</li>
                <li>In May 2013, Disney Channel pulled "Quitting Cold Koala" (<em>Jessie</em>) due to parental concerns over a scene in which a character's gluten-free diet leads to ridicule.[90]</li>
                <li>On June 13, 2023, the opening sequence of the series <em>Primos</em>, which premiered on the Disney Channel in July 2024, was released by Disney Branded Television,[91][92] with a mixed reception to the sequence on social media, including from Latinos and Mexicans.[93][94][95] Some viewers argued that the sequence had various negative stereotypes, complained about names of some characters, and claimed the Spanish pronunciation of some characters in the sequence was incorrect.[96][97][98]</li>
