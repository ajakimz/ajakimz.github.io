    <h1>Design Reflection</h1>
    <p style="max-width: 600px;">When creating my design system, I started with green since it has always been one of my favorite colors and feels authentic to 
        who I am. From there, I built a palette of complementary shades that gave off a vintage 70s vibe, which connects closely with my personal style and love 
        for retro aesthetics. My typography choices also reflected this vibe, reinforcing the overall tone of my system and tying everything together. I felt that 
        both the colors and fonts authentically represented my personality, and my friends even commented that the look and feel matched me well. Accessibility 
        requirements had a strong influence on my design decisions, especially when I tested color contrast. All of my chosen colors passed accessibility checks 
        with black text but failed with white text, which meant I had to avoid white text entirely. This was difficult because white text often looks sharp and 
        modern, but prioritizing accessibility meant sticking with black to make the design usable for everyone. The biggest challenge was balancing what I wanted 
        aesthetically with what worked best for readability, but it ultimately helped me create a stronger, more thoughtful system. <br> Throughout this process, I 
        was surprised by how challenging it was to find colors that passed accessibility requirements. I also ran into some unexpected technical issues, 
        particularly with getting my typography to display correctly in my code, which forced me to troubleshoot and learn more about the technical side of 
        styling. These challenges showed me how much thought and testing goes into creating a cohesive system. Looking ahead, I know these lessons will be 
        helpful when I begin my portfolio project, since Iâ€™ll already have experience checking for accessibility and balancing visual style with usability. If 
        I expand my system in the future, I would like to add more variations of links and buttons in colors that both make sense visually and meet accessibility 
        standards. The typography felt like the most flexible element, since I could change it easily once my code was corrected, while the color palette was less 
        flexible because of accessibility constraints. Still, those limitations pushed me to make more intentional choices, and I can see how this design system 
        will provide a strong foundation to build on in future projects.</p>
