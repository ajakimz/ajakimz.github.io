        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            Currently a 3rd year student at the University of Colorado Boulder getting a Bachelor of Science in Creative Technology and Design with a minor in Business. My focus is in UI/UX and I will also be getting a certificate in UX Design from CU Boulder.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am originally from Spokane, WA and before coming to Boulder, CO I completed my studies at Spokane Falls Community College to receive my Associate of Arts.

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>
            My interests include learning more about UI/UX research and design and how I can make websites most accessible to as many users as posible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, I am also very passionate about dancing, as I have been doing it for 18 years, and I'm also a Captain on the Club Dance Team at CU Boulder. When I'm not dancing I also love to travel, which I like to credit to my avid traveling parents. My favorite place I've visited has been London and Sydney, Australia, however a fan favorite and a story I always love to tell is going to Antarctica.

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>
            I want to learn more about universal design and accessibility through my Web and Universal Design for Digitial Media courses that I am currently taking at my university.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, I hope to create a working personal portfolio that I can share with employeers to help show what I provide and my previous experience in digital design and such.
