            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>The Movie Club website was designed to address a specific need in my community of a centralized space for people who love movies to track films they’ve seen, discover upcoming screenings, and engage in discussions or other related activities. While I did not conduct formal research, my observations of myself and my friends provided valuable insight into this need. We often found ourselves wanting a single platform to keep track of movies we had already watched while also staying informed about upcoming releases or local screenings. This reflection of our personal experiences shaped the vision for the site. By creating a digital hub that organizes movie information, enables RSVPs for events, and encourages social interaction, the site fulfills a community desire for both organization and engagement around shared interests in film.</p>
            <p>To serve the needs of movie enthusiasts, I implemented several interactive features. The site includes genre filters, which allow users to sort movies according to their preferences, making it easier to find content that aligns with their interests. On the upcoming screenings page, I added RSVP buttons so users can indicate which events they plan to attend. These buttons are interactive, updating both the row in the table and a feedback message at the top of the page to confirm their selection. Only one RSVP can be selected at a time, ensuring clarity and reducing confusion. Additionally, users can expand the privacy statement at the bottom of each page for further transparency, which encourages trust. All of these interactive elements serve the community by making the site engaging, informative, and responsive to user actions.</p>
            <p>Privacy and data management were important considerations throughout this project. The site uses a small privacy popup in the corner to ask users if they want their data stored, such as theme preferences or RSVP selections. Users who prefer not to save data can easily clear it using the provided option. Beyond the popup, I included a prominent privacy statement at the bottom of every page to ensure users understand what data is collected, how it is stored, and that it is never shared with third parties. This approach prioritizes transparency and gives users control over their own information, which is essential for building trust within the community.</p>
            <p>Optimizing performance and accessibility was a key focus during development. I gathered feedback from classmates to identify areas for improvement and ensure the site was user-friendly. I also used technical tools such as the W3C HTML checker and Lighthouse in the browser’s inspection tools to verify that the website met performance standards. While I tested the site using a screen reader during the early stages, I acknowledge that additional accessibility testing is needed to confirm that all interactive elements, navigation, and content are fully usable for individuals with visual or motor impairments.</p>
            <p>One of the most challenging aspects of this project was managing the separation of CSS and JavaScript files. Adding new elements required careful consideration of how these files would affect the layout and functionality of the site. Through this process, I developed new skills in debugging, maintaining clean code, and continuously testing the website to ensure it looked and functioned as intended. I also gained a deeper understanding of the possibilities within CSS and JavaScript for creating responsive, interactive features that enhance the user experience.</p>
            <p>Given more time and resources, I would enhance the visual appeal of the homepage to create a more engaging first impression for visitors. I would also explore integrating the site with external movie databases, such as Letterboxd or AMC, to automatically populate movie information and reduce manual data entry. Additionally, I would conduct more thorough accessibility testing, using a variety of screen readers and other tools, to ensure that the site is fully inclusive and functional for all users, regardless of their abilities.</p>
            <p>Overall, this project allowed me to combine personal observation, technical skill, and community awareness to create a functional, interactive, and user-centered website. It strengthened my abilities in web development while highlighting the importance of accessibility, privacy, and user engagement.</p>
