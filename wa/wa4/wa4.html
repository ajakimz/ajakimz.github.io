                During my peer review, I received several helpful comments about the accessibility and visual design of my website. One piece of feedback noted 
                that the buttons in the navigation bar looked visually appealing, but the hover state color might be too dark for the black text according to a 
                color contrast checker. After testing this, I confirmed that it does not meet contrast requirements. To address this, I plan to either lighten 
                the hover color or change the text color during the hover state to ensure it passes accessibility standards.
            </p>

                Another comment suggested that I incorporate more of my color palette throughout the site. Currently, I am primarily using the main green that 
                the palette is based on, while four additional colors are underutilized. I aim to integrate these colors more consistently across the website 
                to create a more dynamic and cohesive visual experience. Finally, my peer reviewer noted that the links on the contact page may also fail the 
                color contrast check. Upon reviewing, I confirmed this is the case, so I will adjust the link colors, either by darkening them or using one of the 
                other colors in my palette to improve readability and accessibility.

                While reviewing my partner's website, I was able to assist them with creating a button for their navigation bar. After they implemented it, 
                I explained the importance of adding padding inside the button so that users can more clearly recognize it as an interactive element. I helped 
                them adjust the padding to make it larger and also demonstrated how to create rounded corners if they wanted a softer visual style. Beyond the 
                button, I thought their website was well-designed overall. I recommended that they run W3C Validation and test their site with a screen reader 
                and at 200% zoom to ensure proper code semantics and accessibility, making sure the site is readable and usable for all users.
