            <h2>Critcal Reflection & Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                The design of my Movie Club website was guided by the specific needs of the local movie community. Using CSS Grid, I created distinct layouts for 
                the featured movies and upcoming screenings pages, organizing content to prioritize clarity and accessibility. The featured movies page allows 
                users to browse and filter films by genre, while the upcoming screenings page highlights events with clear headings, a selectable list, and 
                feedback. These grids provide a logical reading flow, making it easier for users to find relevant information and take action without being 
                overwhelmed. Accessibility considerations, such as keyboard navigation, aria-live feedback, and high-contrast selections, ensure the site is 
                inclusive for users with different abilities.

                The interactive JavaScript features were carefully chosen to serve community needs rather than for visual flair. The genre filter on the featured 
                movies page helps users quickly find content relevant to their interests, and the selectable upcoming screenings list provides immediate feedback 
                while allowing deselection. User testing revealed that spacing, selection feedback, and clarity of interactive elements were critical, leading to 
                adjustments that improved usability and visual clarity. Feedback also challenged my initial assumptions about subtle design cues, showing that 
                clear, unambiguous interactions are more effective in a community-focused site. Given more time, I would explore additional personalization 
                features, such as saving selections or notifications, while maintaining accessibility and usability.

                Privacy and user agency were key considerations throughout development. No personal user data is stored; all interactions occur locally, giving 
                users full control over filtering and selecting screenings. The design also acknowledges potential biases, such as genre selection or the order of 
                events, and highlights the importance of representing diverse community interests in future iterations. Overall, the project demonstrates how 
                thoughtful technical decisions (like grid layouts, interactive functionality, and accessibility) can create a meaningful and usable experience, 
                emphasizing that web development should prioritize serving real community needs while maintaining user trust and empowerment.
