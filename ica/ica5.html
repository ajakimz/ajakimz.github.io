        <h3>Post-Activity Reflection</h3>
        <p>
            During this activity, setting up the Flexbox layout was a little challenging, particularly when it came to spacing and paragraph breaks between different sections. I chose to hide the 
            content by default so that users would need to actively click the button to reveal information. I think this is useful for pages with a lot of content, as it reduces visual clutter 
            and allows users to focus on what they want to see. However, I also realized that for users relying on screen readers, collapsing content could be tedious, as they would need to 
            navigate and open each section individually. In terms of accessibility, I made the expand button a complete circle, which is visually clean, but its small size could be an issue 
            for users with vision impairments or motor challenges. These technical choices directly affect user control and highlight the balance between aesthetic design and accessibility.
            <br>
            On a broader level, this micro-interaction made me reflect on the dynamics between user autonomy and designer control. I appreciate giving users the ability to reveal content 
            themselves while also allowing designers to hide less critical information, as it makes a site more interactive and less cluttered. This exercise also made me think about which 
            content should always be visible versus what can be hidden: important information, like the date and time of an event, should be immediately accessible, while supplementary 
            details could be tucked away in a collapsible section. These small design decisions can influence who feels empowered by a digital space and who may feel frustrated, highlighting 
            the importance of balancing cognitive load with accessibility and clarity.
